## Find Longest Bitonic Subarray in a given array

Write a Java program to find Longest Bitonic Subarray in a given array.

A bitonic subarray is a subarray of a given array where elements are first sorted in increasing order, then in decreasing order. A strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subarray is also accepted as bitonic subarray.

Example:

Input :

nums = { 4, 5, 9, 5, 6, 10, 11, 9, 6, 4, 5 }

Output:

The longest bitonic subarray is [3,9]

Elements of the said sub-array: 5 6 10 11 9 6 4

The length of longest bitonic subarray is 7
