## Find contiguous subarray within a given array of integers which has the largest sum

Write a Java program to find contiguous subarray within a given array of integers which has the largest sum.

In computer science, the maximum sum subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array A[1...n] of numbers. Formally, the task is to find indices and with, such that the sum is as large as possible.

Example:

Input :

int[] A = {1, 2, -3, -4, 0, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Output:

The largest sum of contiguous sub-array: 30
