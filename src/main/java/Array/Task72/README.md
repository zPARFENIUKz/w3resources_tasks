## Find and print one continuous subarray to sort an entire array

Write a Java program to find and print one continuous subarray (from a given array of integers) that if you only sort the said subarray in ascending order then the entire array will be sorted in ascending order.

Example:

Input :

nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 6}

nums2 = { 1, 3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 4, 8}

Output:

Continuous subarray:

1 2 3 0

Continuous subarray:
